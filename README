# sometimes the influxdb stops working, and sometimes it can be fixed with:
journalctl -u influxdb -f
sudo service influxdb stop
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/influxdb/data/_internal
sudo service influxdb stop


# services
# service startup files are in ls /etc/systemd/system
# use sudo systemctl service xxxx start to start one.
# use sudo service xxxx restart to restart one (or do we need to use systemctl?)
# use sudo journalctl -f -u xxxx # to monitor the output
# sudo journalctl -u xxxx  # dumps all the recent history?

# list of services:
pzem_mqtt.service  - the pzem / usb power monitoring      - /home/jfstepha/bin/my-pi-thermostat/pzem_mqtt.py  - I wrote it, uses minimalmodbus
pylitterrobot_mqtt - litter robot                         - /home/jfstepha/bin/my-pi-thermostat/pylitterrobot_mqtt.py - started with github example

# misc stuff
# for the MyQ garage door bindings:
#   - Add the bridge
#   - Go to openhab -> things -> click the blue + in the corner to add a new thing
#   - Select the MyQ binding
#   - Click the blue "Scan" up at top.  It should find the garage door and add them to the inbox.
#   - Add the new devices from the inbox
# It didn't work to just add the garage door without the binding finding them first.
